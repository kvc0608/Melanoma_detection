## General Information
- To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma
- Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths
- Identification of melanoma at earlier stages
- International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC)


## Conclusions
- The initial CNN model built was overfitting the data
- Augmentor library was used to resolve overfitting
- The final model has a good training and validation accuracy
- The model can be further improved by tuning further hyper parameters



## Technologies Used
- Tensor flow
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
